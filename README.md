# SYNOPSIS

    use Cache::Memory::Simple;
    use feature qw/state/;

    sub get_stuff {
        my ($class, $key) = @_;

        state $cache = Cache::Memory::Simple->new();
        $cache->get_or_set(
            $key, sub {
                Storage->get($key) # slow operation
            }, 10 # cache in 10 seconds
        );
    }

- $obj->set($key, $val, $expiration)

- $obj->get\_or\_set($key, $code, $expiration)
